WischWasch
========

[WischWasch](https://wischwasch2.appspot.com/) is a project to improve your timeline. People change over time and our own interests change as well. 
As we add more and more people, our timelines get cluttered to the point that we don't enjoy them anymore.
Instead of unfollowing everyone from time to time, I choose to build something that let's me improve my 
timline gradually. Through simple swipes. [Try it now!](https://wischwasch2.appspot.com/)

How does it work?
------------------------------------------------------
You decide for each update if you like it (swipe right) or not (swipe left). After several updates you get some stats
on how much you liked or disliked tweets from a certain person.

Who are you?
------------------------------------------------------
I am [@Luca](https://twitter.com/luca). I can't code but I enjoy it.

ToDo-List
------------------------------------------------------
* Set up Git and Google App Engine
* Write about the goal of the project
* Add demo content
* Add search
* Fix twitter login
* Add new todos

Ideas
------------------------------------------------------
* Support other platforms
* Apps with same functionality but paid for iOS/Android/Windows 10
* Visuals
* Big data recommendation thingy

Help me!
------------------------------------------------------
If you find it intersting what the project does, help me by testing it, reporting bugs and improving the code.
For now all communication should flow through Github-Issues.
