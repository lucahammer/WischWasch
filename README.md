WischWasch
========

[WischWasch](https://wischwasch2.appspot.com/) is a project to improve your timeline. People change over time and our own interests change as well. 
As we add more and more people, our timelines get cluttered to the point that we don't enjoy them anymore.
Instead of unfollowing everyone from time to time, I choose to build something that let's me improve my 
timline gradually. Through simple swipes. [Try it now!](https://wischwasch2.appspot.com/)

How does it work?
------------------------------------------------------
You decide for each update if you like it (swipe right) or not (swipe left). After each swipe the table with the results
gets updated. You can sort it by tipping on the table headings. In the future more complex stuff could be added.

About Luca
------------------------------------------------------
I am [@Luca](https://twitter.com/luca). I can't code but I enjoy it. As a result there is a lot of spaghetti code. 
I am aware of many problems in the code (every function should have one input, one output and one task, max 5 lines? whoops.).
I am glad about feedback and you can tell me even the obvious because for me it isn't always obvious. Want to refactor the code? 
You are welcome! Take the ideas and code your own implementation because mine is crap? Do it!

ToDo-List
------------------------------------------------------
* Write about the goal of the project - [done (in german)](http://www.2-blog.net/2016/01/01/das-ist-wischwasch-timeline-aufraeumen/)
* Add mechanism to prevent multiple votes on the same tweet (done)
* Undo button (works with keyboard)
* Swipe up/down to vote neutral
* Option Panel (exclude Retweets, Replies, Links, Images; swipe right == heart)
* Add option to rate tweets of a single account, list,...
* Save ratings in a database
* Add new todos

Ideas
------------------------------------------------------
* Support other platforms
* Apps with same functionality but paid for iOS/Android/Windows 10
* Visuals
* Import other clues (likes, mutes, RTs,...)
* Big data recommendation thingy ("You dislike tweets with these URLs, topics,...")
* Discover new accounts (rate accounts you don't follow but your followings follow)

Help me!
------------------------------------------------------
If you find it intersting what the project does, help me by testing it, reporting bugs and improving the code.
For now all communication should flow through Github-Issues.
